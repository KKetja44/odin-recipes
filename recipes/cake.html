   <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
   <p><h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180°C. Grease a loaf pan, approximately 23 cm long x 14 cm wide.</li>
        <li>Cream together 200g butter or margarine and 200g sugar.</li>
        <li>Add the 4 eggs to the mixture one by one and beat well after each addition. In a separate bowl, sift together 300g flour, 10ml baking powder plus a pinch of salt and stir into the mixture bit by bit, alternating with 100ml milk.</li>
        <li>Colour the mixture bright pink to red with the food colouring (start with a small amount and then keep adding until you get the colour you want). Pour the mixture into the prepared tray and bake in the oven for approximately 55 minutes. Test with a skewer - it should come out clean when the cake is done.</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool for about 10 minutes and remove it from the tin. Leave the cake to cool anad, once completely cooled, cut into thick slices.</li>
        <li>Cut heart shapes out of the slices of cake. Use leftover cake to make cake pops or for a trifle.</li>
        <li>Prepare the cake mixture a second time as described in steps 1-3. Pour a small amount of the mixture onto the bottom of the prepared loaf pan. Pack the hearts very closely together in a row on the mixture.  They must be as tightly packed as you can. Fill pan with the rest of the mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake for approximately 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Once cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool as before.</li>
        <li>Ice the cake with the chocolate spread and decorate with sprinkles. Cut the cake into slices and serve, enjoying every heart, one bite at a time.</li>
